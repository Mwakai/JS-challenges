/**
 * Coding Challenge #1
 * Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is calculated using the formula:
 * BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height) (mass in kg and height in meter).
 * 
 * 1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables
 * 2. Calculate both their BMIs using the formula (BMI = mass / height ** 2)
 * 3. Create a boolean variable 'markHigherBMI' containing information about whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.
 * 
 * TEST DATA 1: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weights 92 kg and is 1.95 m tall.
 * TEST DATA 2: Marks weights 95 kg and is 1.88 m tall. John weights 85 kg and is 1.76 m tall.
 * 
 * GOOD LUCK ðŸ˜€

/**
 * Use the BMI example from Challenge #1, and the code you already wrote, and improve it:

1. Print a nice output to the console, telling the user who has the higher BMI. The message can be either:

"Mark's BMI is higher than John's!" or "John's BMI is higher than Mark's!".

2. Modify the outputs above to use template literals to include the BMI values in the outputs.

Example: "Mark's BMI (28.3) is higher than John's (23.9)!" or "John's BMI (29.1) is higher than Mark's (27)!".

Note: Don't round the BMI values. Leave them as they are.
